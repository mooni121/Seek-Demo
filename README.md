# Seek-PreAlpha
Seek is a 2D exploration pre-alpha entirely made by Sophia Ramirez in Unity version 2021.3.16f1. The pre-alpha began development April 24, 2023 and was completed on May 2, 2023.

### About:

Seek was Sophia Ramirez's first original game. Seek was an assignment for Georgia Virtual School's Game Design Animation and Simulation course. The assignment required that a unique game be created by the student within a one week deadline. All assets, designs, music, and coding was created by Sophia Ramirez. Seek is a passion project of Ramirez, and she plans on taking this project further in the future with new areas, features, music, and mechanics.
